NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

A jQuery plugin for adding an easy 'are you sure' confirmation pop-up before the handler in .on() is called.


##Installing

Grab jquery.confirmon.js from the repository and insert the following line _after_ the jQuery script in your code:
```html
<script src="jquery.ajaxstartdelay.js"></script>
```

That's all.

Maybe you want to use the stylesheet that creates an screenwide overlay and a centered box. No problem, just
add jquery.confirmon.css to your html.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jquery.confirmon.css"/>
```

Since there are only a few classes involved you might better insert the classes into your existing stylesheet.

##Usage

Use .confirmOn() the same way as you use jQuery's .on(). Check http://api.jquery.com/on/ for the documentation.

There are some options that can be set to customize the plugin. Add them as the first argument of .confirmOn().




##Example

Make sure the jQuery and plugin scripts are loaded.
